=====

A GUI to graph java dependencies between jars, classes, packages and projects (currently eclipse projects only).

This tool can be used to :
* Analyze legacy code-bases that do not rely on dependency management systems (such as maven or 
ivy) and then produce information that facilitate migration to these systems;
* Locate, and fix cyclic dependencies;
* Understand how a project is structured to gain comprehension quicker.

There is still a lot of work to do - the tool only provides basic functionality currently.
